          Hello, my name is Brett Heistinger and I am one of the <span className="no-wrap">co-founders</span> of Galaxy Sounds.
          I'm currently a Hardware Designer, providing electrical and mechanical solutions to our products.
          Being able to develop solutions for fellow musicians has been a dream of mine for a while
          and I can't put into words how excited I am for Galaxy Sounds. Actually, you could say I'm over the moon about it...
